# Visualization with Three.js

I'm interested in learning some basic visualization tools. I will start using Three.js simply because my colleagues are using it too, and I need to at least learn some bases. 

I will follow step by step the online book at `https://discoverthreejs.com/book/first-steps/app-structure/`, and try to have fun along the way.
