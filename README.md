# Visualization with three.js

I'm interested in learning some basic visualization tools. I will start using Three.js simply because my colleagues are using it too, and I need to at least learn some bases. 

I am following step by step the amazing book [Discover three.js](https://discoverthreejs.com) by Lewy Blue, and try to have fun along the way. Sometimes I will take the time to try and solve the exercises, which mean that my code my get messier than some of the examples showed in the book, bear with me.

My project is set up in the same way as suggested in the book, but I do not keep track of the Node.js modules necessary in `git`. In the same way, I will not track on Github the external assets that will be used along the book. Following the book convention, in the code I call `./vendor/` the folder in which I keep my modules.
